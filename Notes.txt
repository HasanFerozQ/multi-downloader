One thing to exclude first (to keep the zip small) — delete or skip these folders before zipping:

backend/venv/
frontend/node_modules/
frontend/.next/


# Terminal 1

No rate limiting (anyone can hammer your server), no download queue/Redis yet (concurrent downloads will slow each other down), FB/IG/TikTok require cookies for most content (private or logged-in content will fail), no progress bar during download, temp files could pile up if the server crashes mid-download, and the app has no way to handle platform bot detection which YouTube increasingly uses.



1. Preparation: The "Legal" Foundation
Before applying for ads or hosting, we must finalize the content that makes the site look "Premium" to crawlers:

Terms of Service & Privacy Policy: Dedicated pages that define user responsibility and data handling.

Rectangle Support Section: A clean UI block containing your Binance Pay ID (86846518), a QR code, and a global USDT (TRC-20) wallet address.

One-Click Support: A direct Binance Payment Link for instant USDT donations.

2. Infrastructure: Hosting & Domain
Since you can afford the $6/month DigitalOcean VPS, we avoid the "sleeping" issues of free tiers:

Frontend: Host on Vercel or Netlify ($0) for global speed and automatic GitHub deployments.

Backend (The Droplet): A 1GB RAM Ubuntu VPS to run FastAPI, Redis, and Celery.

Media Engine: Install FFmpeg on the VPS to handle high-resolution 1080p merging using the H.264 (avc1) codec for 100% compatibility.

Domain: Register a cheap domain (e.g., .xyz or .site) and point it to your VPS IP.

3. Monetization: Adsterra & PropellerAds
We will skip AdSense to avoid copyright bans and use networks that specialize in utility traffic:

Ad Stacking: Use Adsterra for the 160x600 side pillars and PropellerAds for the sticky footer and Anti-AdBlock features.

Clean Mode: Maintain user trust by offering a "Hide Ads" toggle, which encourages users to donate via Binance instead.

Payment: Withdraw your ad earnings directly in Crypto/USDT, fitting your project's theme.

4. Execution Roadmap
Push Code: Move your finalized page.tsx, worker.py, and legal pages to GitHub.

Launch Frontend: Connect GitHub to Vercel/Netlify to get a live URL.

Setup VPS: Create the DigitalOcean Droplet, install dependencies (Python, Redis, FFmpeg), and run the backend.

Connect Both: Update your frontend BACKEND_URL to point to your VPS IP/Domain.

Monetize: Once the site is live and functional, submit the URL to Adsterra and PropellerAds for instant/fast approval.
